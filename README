Description: Output to LCD modules that are supported by LCDproc 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

vdr -Plcdproc or -P"lcdproc -h <host> -p <port>" ... makes vdr connect to a LCDd.

Current channel info and menus are then displayed on the LCD too.

I had a 4x20 character display in mind but it should
work with 4x16 up to 4x40 and 2x40.

LCDd can be used in an xterm or console too, so it
might be useful even without having the hardware. 
( ./LCDd -d curses )

lcdtranstbl.h is used to map characters for output to LCDd.
Depending on the LCD hardware some characters may not displayed
correctly, you can fix that by selecting a in the setup menu: (Charmap)

0 ... nomap         no mapping, useful for the curses driver
1 ... hd44780       
2 ... CFontz        Thanks to Stephan Schreiber <stephan@sschreiber.de>

lcdkeyconf.h is used to configure the plugin for a keypad.


LCDproc is available at http://lcdproc.omnipotent.net/
or here http://sourceforge.net/projects/lcdproc/

  What's needed to run a LCD?
  
   Hardware:

     I used a single 4x20 LCD that works with the hd44780 8-bit driver on 
     the printer port.

                     LED+ (15) (connected to +5V over a 100Ohm resisitor
                                to make it not too bright)
                     LED- (16) (connected to GND) 

   Software:

     Last tested with lcdproc-0.4.1 ( http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/lcdproc/lcdproc-0.4.1.tar.gz )
     LCDd -d HD44780 "-p 0x3bc -c winamp"
     should run LCDd for the hardware described above conneceted to the
     printer port (in my case the port's base address is 0x3bc).
